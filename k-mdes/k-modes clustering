[Functions]
is_changed(old,new,num_cluster,labels)
-Compare the current mode vectors with the new mode vectors to return the change.
-Parameters
 	old (dataframe type): current mode vectors.
 	new (dataframe type): new mode vectors.
 	num_cluster (an integer greater than or equal to one): The number of clusters to form as well as the number of modes to generate.
 	labels (list type): List of column names for dataset used.
-Returns : Returns 1 if there are changes or returns 0 if no change.

find_vector(x,num_cluster,vectors)
-Calculate the new mode vectors.
-Parameters
 	x (shape = (n_samples, n_features), dataframe type): Dataset to cluster.
 	num_cluster (an integer greater than or equal to one): The number of clusters to form as well as the number of modes to generate.
 	vectors (dataframe type): current mode vectors.
-Returns : Returns new vectors.


get_distance(x,data,labels,vector)
-Calculate the distance between vector and one record of dataset. (dissimilarity measure)
-Parameters
 	x (shape = (n_samples, n_features), dataframe type): Dataset to cluster.
 	data (dataframe type): one record of dataset(x) to compute.
 	labels (list type): List of column names for dataset used.
 	vectors (dataframe type): current mode vector.
-Returns : Returns the distance computed.

clustering(x,labels,vectors,list_clusters)
- Calculate the distance from the clusters and do clustering them as clusters with the least distance.
-Parameters
 	x (shape = (n_samples, n_features), dataframe type): Dataset to cluster.
 	vectors (dataframe type): current mode vectors.
 	labels (list type): List of column names for dataset used.
 	list_clusters (list type): List of column names for clusters.
-Returns : Returns the x completed clustering.

k_modes(x,num_cluster,labels)
- Do k=modes clustering.
-Parameters
 	x (shape = (n_samples, n_features), dataframe type): Dataset to cluster.
 	num_cluster (an integer greater than or equal to one): The number of clusters to form as well as the number of modes to generate.
 	labels (list type): List of column names for dataset used.
-Returns : Returns the x completed k-modes clustering.

purity(clusters, classes)
- Calculate the purity.
-Parameters
 	clusters (dataframe type): results of clustering.(data[‘flag’])
 	classes (dataframe type): real values.(target column)
-Returns : Returns the result of purity calculation.
